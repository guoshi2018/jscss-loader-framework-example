        <p>
          Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
          continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
          proposition that all men are created equal.
          <span class="more">. . .</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
          or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
          met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
          portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
          their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
          proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot
          dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow, this ground.
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="more">show/hide more</a>
        <p>
          The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
          it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
          note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget
          what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
          here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far
          so nobly advanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
          before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we take increased
          devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
          devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
          have died in vain&mdash;that this nation, under God, shall have a new
          birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for
          the people, shall not perish from the earth.
